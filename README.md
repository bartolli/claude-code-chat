## üí° **Usage Examples**

### üî• **Code Review & Refactoring**
```
You: @src/components/UserProfile.tsx Can you review this component and suggest improvements?

Claude: I'll analyze your UserProfile component. Looking at the code, here are my recommendations:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Add React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **TypeScript Enhancement**: The props interface could be more specific
3. **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels for screen readers

[Detailed analysis with code examples follows...]
```

### üìä **Project Analysis**
```
You: Analyze the overall architecture of my project and identify potential issues

Claude: I'll examine your project structure and identify areas for improvement:

üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js backend with Express
- MongoDB database layer

‚ö†Ô∏è **Identified Issues**
- Missing error boundaries in React components
- Database queries lack proper indexing
- API routes missing input validation

[Detailed recommendations with implementation examples...]
```

### üêõ **Debugging Assistant**
```
You: I'm getting a strange error in my API. Here's the stack trace: [paste error]

Claude: Looking at this stack trace, the issue appears to be a race condition in your async middleware. Here's what's happening:

1. **Root Cause**: Multiple requests are modifying shared state
2. **Solution**: Implement proper request isolation
3. **Prevention**: Add comprehensive error handling

[Step-by-step debugging guide follows...]
```

### ‚è™ **Safe Experimentation with Checkpoints**
```
You: Can you refactor this entire component to use hooks instead of class components?

Claude: I'll refactor your component to use React hooks. Don't worry - I'll create a checkpoint first so you can easily restore if needed.

[Creates automatic checkpoint]

Here's the refactored component using hooks:

If you want to revert these changes, just click "Restore Checkpoint" to go back to your original code instantly.
