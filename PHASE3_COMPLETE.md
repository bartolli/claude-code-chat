# Phase 3: State Management - Complete ✅

## Summary
Phase 3 has been successfully completed with comprehensive Redux state management implementation and full test coverage.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Redux Store Configuration
- Implemented Redux Toolkit with TypeScript
- Created modular store structure following GUI patterns
- Configured middleware for VS Code environment
- Added global reset action for test isolation

### 2. State Slices Created
- **Session Slice**: Manages Claude sessions, messages, and token tracking
- **Config Slice**: Handles model selection, preferences, and settings
- **UI Slice**: Controls webview state, tool expansion, and display preferences
- **Processes Slice**: Tracks active Claude CLI processes

### 3. StateManager Facade
- Created backward-compatible wrapper around Redux store
- Maintains existing extension API signatures
- Provides simple interface for state operations
- Integrates with VS Code workspace state for persistence

### 4. Selectors
- Created memoized selectors for efficient state access
- Aggregate selectors for total costs and token counts
- Process tracking and session management selectors

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- 103 tests passing
- Full coverage of all state operations
- Proper test isolation with state reset
- Tests for:
  - Redux store operations
  - StateManager facade
  - All state slices (session, config, UI, processes)
  - Selectors and computed values

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Data Structure Changes
- Changed `expandedTools` from `Set<string>` to `Record<string, boolean>` to avoid Immer/Set compatibility issues
- Maintained compatibility with existing extension patterns

### 2. Model Types
- Aligned with actual Claude CLI models: 'opus', 'sonnet', 'default'
- Not the full model names but the CLI flag values

### 3. Test Architecture
- Added global reset action for proper test isolation
- Mock context for VS Code workspace state in tests
- Comprehensive test suites for each component

## Integration Points

### With Existing Extension
- StateManager provides same API as existing methods
- Maps to existing properties like `_currentSessionId`, `_selectedModel`
- Maintains backward compatibility

### With Service Layer
- Integrated into ServiceContainer
- Available to all services through dependency injection
- Ready for use in stream processing and protocol layers

### Future GUI Integration
- Redux store structure matches GUI expectations
- State shape designed for webview communication
- Ready for protocol-based messaging

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Get state manager instance
const stateManager = ServiceContainer.getInstance().stateManager;

// Session management
stateManager.createOrResumeSession('session-123', 'My Chat');
const sessionId = stateManager.getCurrentSessionId();

// Model selection
stateManager.setSelectedModel('opus');
const model = stateManager.getSelectedModel();

// Process tracking
stateManager.trackProcess(sessionId, 12345);
stateManager.setClaudeRunning(true);

// Token and cost tracking
const totals = stateManager.getTotalTokens();
const cost = stateManager.getTotalCost();
```

## Next Steps
Phase 3 is complete. The extension now has:
- ✅ Centralized state management
- ✅ Full backward compatibility
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Foundation for GUI integration

Ready to proceed with:
- Phase 4: Stream Processing (AsyncGenerators)
- Phase 5: Protocol-Based Communication
- Phase 6: GUI Integration Preparation
