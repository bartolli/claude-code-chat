# Thinking Indicator Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Processing State Not Showing**: The initial processing state with rotating messages wasn't displaying because we weren't creating an assistant message and sending the initial thinking state early enough.

2. **Thinking Not Transitioning to Completed**: The thinking indicator wasn't transitioning to "Thought for X.xs" because the completion event was handled correctly but the UI wasn't receiving the proper state updates.

## Changes Made

### ExtensionMessageHandler.ts

1. **Added Initial Processing State** (lines 209-223):
   - Create empty assistant message with `isThinkingActive: true` when user sends a message
   - Send initial thinking indicator with empty content to trigger rotating messages
   - This ensures the processing state shows immediately

2. **Added Missing Properties** (lines 33-35):
   - Added `waitingForPlan`, `hasReceivedPlan`, and `isInPlanMode` properties that were referenced but not declared

3. **Fixed Type Error**:
   - Changed `'chat/stop'` to `'chat/stopRequest'` to match the protocol definition

4. **Preserved Existing Logic**:
   - Kept the thinking completion logic that sends `isActive: false` with duration when result is received
   - Maintained the accumulation of thinking content and line tracking

## Flow Summary

1. User sends message → Create empty assistant message with `isThinkingActive: true`
2. Send initial thinking state with empty content → Shows rotating processing messages
3. If Claude enters thinking mode → Update with actual thinking content
4. When result received → Send final thinking update with `isActive: false` and duration
5. UI shows "Thought for X.xs" with the duration

## Testing Needed

1. Test with messages that don't trigger thinking mode - should show processing then regular response
2. Test with messages that trigger thinking mode - should show processing → thinking → completed
3. Test duration display and first line preview in completed state
