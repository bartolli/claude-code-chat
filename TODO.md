# TODO - StateManager Migration Project

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Phase 0: Pre-migration safety net - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: ActionMapper implementation - COMPLETED
- üîÑ Hooks Implementation Planning - IN PROGRESS
- ‚è≥ Phase 2: ExtensionMessageHandler Integration - READY TO START

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created comprehensive integration tests for current message flow
- [x] Documented all webview ‚Üî backend message types
- [x] Implemented feature flag system
- [x] Created StateComparator utility
- [x] Implemented ActionMapper with proper TypeScript typing
- [x] Created test harness for safe testing
- [x] Added comprehensive Redux action tests
- [x] Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Tested action mapping successfully

## In Progress
- [ ] Creating hooks implementation plan
- [ ] Designing TypeScript quality hooks
- [ ] Designing project-specific migration hooks

## Next Tasks
### Immediate (Current Session)
- [ ] Review and finalize hooks implementation plan
- [ ] Start implementing Phase 1 hooks:
  - [ ] typescript-quality-check.sh
  - [ ] migration-safety-guard.sh
  - [ ] context-save.sh

### Next Session
- [ ] Complete hooks implementation
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: ExtensionMessageHandler Integration
- [ ] Implement custom handlers for 5 actions that need them
- [ ] Decide on mapping strategy for 3 unmapped actions

## Test Results Summary
- ‚úÖ Basic action mapping works correctly
- ‚úÖ Performance overhead is minimal (0-1ms for 1000 actions)
- ‚úÖ Feature flags working correctly
- üìä Comprehensive test results:
  - 10 actions map directly to Redux
  - 5 actions need custom handlers
  - 3 actions are unmapped

## Important Notes
- All migration code is behind feature flags (disabled by default)
- No production code is affected
- TypeScript compilation is clean (no errors)
- All tests are passing

## Context for Next Session
1. Hooks implementation plan is in `/docs/hooks-implementation-plan.md`
2. Reference hooks are in `/docs/reference/claude-code-hooks-reference/`
3. Migration plan is in `/docs/statemanager-migration-plan.md`
4. Current branch: `feature/safe-statemanager-migration`

## Key Files
- `/src/migration/ActionMapper.ts` - Maps webview actions to Redux
- `/src/migration/StateComparator.ts` - Validates state during migration
- `/src/migration/FeatureFlags.ts` - Controls migration rollout
- `/src/test/migration/` - All migration tests
