# Plan Mode with Bundled TypeScript Hook - Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Created TypeScript/JavaScript hooks** bundled with the extension:
   - `/src/hooks/plan-approval-hook.ts` (TypeScript version)
   - `/src/hooks/plan-approval-hook.js` (JavaScript version for execution)

2. **Updated ExtensionMessageHandler.ts** to:
   - Automatically configure hooks on startup
   - Watch for plan files created by the hook
   - Handle plan approval/refine without file writes

3. **Updated webpack config** to:
   - Copy hook files to output directory during build
   - Added `copy-webpack-plugin` dependency

## Key Benefits

✅ **No user setup required** - Hooks are configured automatically
✅ **TypeScript consistency** - Hook is written in same language as extension
✅ **Bundled distribution** - Hook ships with the extension
✅ **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows/Mac/Linux with Node.js

## How It Works

1. Extension starts → Configures hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`
2. User enables plan mode → `--permission-mode plan` is used
3. Claude calls `exit_plan_mode` → Hook intercepts and saves plan
4. Extension detects plan file → Shows UI with Approve/Refine
5. User approves → Creates approval file, tells Claude to continue
6. Hook sees approval → Allows `exit_plan_mode` to proceed

## Installation Steps

```bash
# Install the copy-webpack-plugin
npm install

# Build the extension
npm run build:extension

# The hook will be automatically configured on first run
```

## Testing

1. Enable plan mode toggle in UI
2. Ask Claude to make code changes
3. Verify plan appears in UI
4. Test approve/refine flows

The hook is now part of the extension package and requires no manual user configuration!
